This next part is the real gravy, the proverbs list. KEEP THEM ORDERED. That means the first list is in alphabetical order, and the second list is the second half of the proverbs, in the same order. Therefore, the second list is not in alphabetical order. And don't forget the commas and quotes. You can use the "display line number" function in your text editor to keep track of lines.
